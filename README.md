## What's Open Source Mycetoma (MycetOS)?
MycetOS is a science project aimed at discovering new medicines for the treatment of a terrible fungal infection, eumycetoma.
The project uses open source principles, meaning that you can get involved as a full partner.

We started on February 6th 2018. [Press release](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Talks-Meetings-Publicity/blob/master/Press%20Release/MycetOS%20news%20release_5Feb2018_FINAL.docx). [One-page description of the whole idea](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Talks-Meetings-Publicity/blob/master/One-Page%20MycetOS%20Explainer/MycetOS%20-%20Open%20Source%20Mycetoma%20v2.pdf). [The first paper that serves as a launchpad](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/02/258905).
The first newsletter is [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Series-1-Fenarimols/issues/43) and you can [sign up for more](https://forms.gle/hHvURWKJQTymhJ9p7).

## Where to Find Things
Everything is online. You're looking at the Github community.
There's also a [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceMycetoma).
There's a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MycetOS).

You can go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here/wiki) to find out the [background](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here/wiki/Current-treatments-for-eumycetoma) of the project, or jump straight to looking at the [series](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here/wiki/Series-and-other-sources) under investigation. Each series functions a little differently depending on what stage they're at, but in general we communicate through issues, while the Wiki acts as a more permanent storage for relevant links and data. 

The molecules related to the project are all in a [spreadsheet](http://tinyurl.com/MycetomaMols).

You can find online lab notebooks from various members of the MycetOS group [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here/wiki/Online-lab-books), or have a look at journal articles and theses published by the group [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here/wiki/Papers-and-theses). 


## What Can You Do?
Take a look at the open issues on the repository [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/What-other-molecules-to-screen/issues) and join the conversation. This is a collection of ideas, suggestions and questions that we're looking for help with. 

Or just come along to a monthly meeting - the 2024 roster can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Monthly-zoom-meetings/issues/2). 

Alternatively take a look at the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceMycetoma).
If things aren't clear, get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MycetOS) (vastly preferred, since it's public) or email (non-preferred, because private. It's opensourcemycetoma@gmail.com).

# Who is MycetOS?
